AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial resistance to available antibiotics has resulted in enhanced 
      efforts at antibiotic stewardship but also has led to investigation into alternative 
      methods for managing surgical infections. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are 
      naturally occurring compounds produced by all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that 
      have potential as an alternative to conventional antibiotics. METHODS: The published 
      literature was reviewed for investigations that were relevant to infections commonly 
      seen by surgeons and the potential applicability of AMPs for surgical care. RESULTS: 
      Antimicrobial peptides are low-molecular-weight peptides with activity against 
      bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Experimental evidence shows that AMPs have activity 
      against highly resistant bacteria identified from human infections. Furthermore, 
      these peptides can be designed as semi-synthetic or totally synthetic constructs for 
      potential clinical use. Antimicrobial peptides appear to have in vivo activity in 
      limited animal studies, but the experimental models for evaluation of these peptides 
      need more clinical relevance. These products are in clinical evaluation at present 
      but are limited in number and are being evaluated primarily for topical 
      applications. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial peptides have considerable in vitro 
      evidence that supports their use for the prevention and treatment of surgical 
      infections. Better experimental and clinical trial efforts are needed to move this 
      technology toward applicability in surgical care.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides in recent years have gained increased interest among 
      scientists, health professionals and the pharmaceutical companies owing to their 
      therapeutic potential. These are low molecular weight proteins with broad range 
      antimicrobial and immuno modulatory activities against infectious bacteria (Gram 
      positive and Gram negative), viruses and fungi. Inability of micro-organisms to 
      develop resistance against most of the antimicrobial peptide has made them as an 
      efficient product which can greatly impact the new era of antimicrobials. In 
      addition to this these peptides also demonstrates increased efficacy, high 
      specificity, decreased drug interaction, low toxicity, biological diversity and 
      direct attacking properties. Pharmaceutical industries are therefore conducting 
      appropriate clinical trials to develop these peptides as potential therapeutic 
      drugs. More than 60 peptide drugs have already reached the market and several 
      hundreds of novel therapeutic peptides are in preclinical and clinical development. 
      Rational designing can be used further to modify the chemical and physical 
      properties of existing peptides. This mini review will discuss the sources, 
      mechanism and recent therapeutic applications of antimicrobial peptides in treatment 
      of infectious diseases.

TI  - Antimicrobial Peptides of Multicellular Organisms: My Perspective.
PG  - 3-6
LID - 10.1007/978-981-13-3588-4_1 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides of multicellular organisms were first characterized in the 
      1980s by investigators who felt that known systems of immunity could not explain 
      what they observed: the resistance to bacterial infection of a Cecropia moth pupa 
      lacking antibodies or lymphocytes (cecropins (Steiner 1981)), the potent 
      microbicidal activity of neutrophils from a rabbit (defensins (Selsted et al. 
      1985)), and the healing of a wound on the skin of the African clawed frog without 
      infection in a non-sterile aquarium (magainins (Zasloff 1987)). Since then AMPs have 
      been discovered in diverse species of fungi, plants, and animals (Seshadri 
      Sundararajan et al. 2012; Fan et al. 2016; Waghu et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2016). It 
      is likely that we will discover that every multicellular organism expresses 
      antimicrobial peptides as a key element of their immune system. Why are 
      antimicrobial peptides so popular in Nature?

      Activity and Biocompatibility In Vivo.

LID - 4
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is projected as one of the greatest threats to human health in 
      the future and hence alternatives are being explored to combat resistance. 
      Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have shown great promise, because use of AMPs leads 
      bacteria to develop no or low resistance. In this review, we discuss the diversity, 
      history and the various mechanisms of action of AMPs. Although many AMPs have 
      reached clinical trials, to date not many have been approved by the US Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) due to issues with toxicity, protease cleavage and short 
      half-life. Some of the recent strategies developed to improve the activity and 
      biocompatibility of AMPs, such as chemical modifications and the use of delivery 
      systems, are also reviewed in this article.

PG  - 5807-22
LID - 10.1007/s00253-014-5792-6 [doi]
AB  - Insects are one of the major sources of antimicrobial peptides/proteins (AMPs). 
      Since observation of antimicrobial activity in the hemolymph of pupae from the giant 
      silk moths Samia Cynthia and Hyalophora cecropia in 1974 and purification of first 
      insect AMP (cecropin) from H. cecropia pupae in 1980, over 150 insect AMPs have been 
      purified or identified. Most insect AMPs are small and cationic, and they show 
      activities against bacteria and/or fungi, as well as some parasites and viruses. 
      Insect AMPs can be classified into four families based on their structures or unique 
      sequences: the Î±-helical peptides (cecropin and moricin), cysteine-rich peptides 
      (insect defensin and drosomycin), proline-rich peptides (apidaecin, drosocin, and 
      lebocin), and glycine-rich peptides/proteins (attacin and gloverin). Among insect 
      AMPs, defensins, cecropins, proline-rich peptides, and attacins are common, while 
      gloverins and moricins have been identified only in Lepidoptera. Most active AMPs 
      are small peptides of 20-50 residues, which are generated from larger inactive 
      precursor proteins or pro-proteins, but gloverins (~14Â kDa) and attacins (~20Â kDa) 
      are large antimicrobial proteins. In this mini-review, we will discuss current 
      knowledge and recent progress in several classes of insect AMPs, including insect 
      defensins, cecropins, attacins, lebocins and other proline-rich peptides, gloverins, 
      and moricins, with a focus on structural-functional relationships and their 
      potential applications.

TI  - The therapeutic applications of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs): a patent review.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1007/s12275-017-6452-1 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small molecules with a broad spectrum of 
      antibiotic activities against bacteria, yeasts, fungi, and viruses and cytotoxic 
      activity on cancer cells, in addition to anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory 
      activities. Therefore, AMPs have garnered interest as novel therapeutic agents. 
      Because of the rapid increase in drug-resistant pathogenic microorganisms, AMPs from 
      synthetic and natural sources have been developed using alternative antimicrobial 
      strategies. This article presents a broad analysis of patents referring to the 
      therapeutic applications of AMPs since 2009. The review focuses on the universal 
      trends in the effective design, mechanism, and biological evolution of AMPs.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are distributed across all kingdoms of life and are an 
      indispensable component of host defenses. They consist of predominantly short 
      cationic peptides with a wide variety of structures and targets. Given the 
      ever-emerging resistance of various pathogens to existing antimicrobial therapies, 
      AMPs have recently attracted extensive interest as potential therapeutic agents. As 
      the discovery of new AMPs has increased, many databases specializing in AMPs have 
      been developed to collect both fundamental and pharmacological information. In this 
      review, we summarize the sources, structures, modes of action, and classifications 
      of AMPs. Additionally, we examine current AMP databases, compare valuable 
      computational tools used to predict antimicrobial activity and mechanisms of action, 
      and highlight new machine learning approaches that can be employed to improve AMP 
      activity to combat global antimicrobial resistance.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides hold promise to supplement small molecules antibiotics and 
      combat the multidrug resistant microbes. There are however technical hurdles towards 
      the clinical applications, largely due to the inherent limitations of peptides 
      including stability, cytotoxicity and bioavailability. Here we review recent studies 
      concerning the delivery and formulation of antimicrobial peptides, by categorizing 
      the different strategies as driven by physical interactions or chemical conjugation 
      reactions, and carriers ranging from inorganic based ones (including gold, silver 
      and silica based solid nanoparticles) to organic ones (including micelle, liposome 
      and hydrogel) are covered. Besides, targeted delivery of antimicrobial peptides or 
      using antimicrobial peptides as the targeting moiety, and responsive release of the 
      peptides after delivery are also reviewed. Lastly, strategies towards the increase 
      of oral bioavailability, from both physical or chemical methods, are highlighted. 
      Altogether, this article provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress of 
      the delivery and formulation of antimicrobial peptides towards clinical application.

AB  - The incorporation of the innate immune system into humans is essential for survival 
      and health due to the rapid replication of invading microbes and the delayed action 
      of the adaptive immune system. Antimicrobial peptides are important components of 
      human innate immunity. Over 100 such peptides have been identified in various human 
      tissues. Human cathelicidin LL-37 is best studied, and there has been a growing 
      interest in designing new peptides based on LL-37. This chapter describes the 
      alternative processing of the human cathelicidin precursor, protease digestion, and 
      lab cutting of LL-37. Both a synthetic peptide library and structure-based design 
      are utilized to identify the active regions. Although challenging, the determination 
      of the 3D structure of LL-37 enabled the identification of the core antimicrobial 
      region. The minimal region of LL-37 can be function-dependent. We discuss the design 
      and potential applications of LL-37 into antibacterial, antibiofilm, antiviral, 
      antifungal, immune modulating, and anticancer peptides. LL-37 has been engineered 
      into 17BIPHE2, a stable, selective, and potent antimicrobial, antibiofilm, and 
      anticancer peptide. Both 17BIPHE2 and SAAP-148 can eliminate the ESKAPE pathogens 
      and show topical in vivo antibiofilm efficacy. Also discussed are other application 
      strategies, including peptide formulation, antimicrobial implants, and 
      peptide-inducing factors such as vitamin D and sunlight. Finally, we summarize what 
      we learned from peptide design based on human LL-37.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been known as host-defense peptides. These 
      cationic and amphipathic peptides are relatively short (â¼5-50Â L-amino acids) with 
      molecular weight less than 10Â kDa. AMPs have various roles including 
      immunomodulatory, angiogenic and antitumor activities. Anticancer peptides (ACPs) 
      are a main subset of AMPs as a novel therapeutic approach against tumor cells. The 
      physicochemical properties of the ACPs influence their cell penetration, stability 
      and efficiency of targeting. Up to now, several databases and web servers for in 
      silico prediction of AMPs/ACPs have been established prior to the lab analysis. The 
      present review focuses on the recent advancement about AMPs/ACPs activities 
      including their in silico prediction by computational tools and their potential 
      applications as therapeutic agents especially in cancer.
